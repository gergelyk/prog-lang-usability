# Chaining Methods

**Objective**: Demonstrate how to chain methods commonly used in functional programming.

### Python

```python
{{#include chaining1.py}}
```

Alternatively we can use generator-expressions (or list comprehensions):

```python
{{#include chaining2.py}}
```

### Rust

```rust
{{#include chaining1.rs}}
```

Alternatively:

```rust
{{#include chaining2.rs}}
```

### Crystal

```crystal
{{#include chaining1.cr}}
```

Alternatively:

```crystal
{{#include chaining2.cr}}
```
