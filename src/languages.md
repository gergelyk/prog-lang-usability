# Languages

Following programming languages have been looked at in this book:

**Python**

- Interpreted[^1]
- Dynamically typed[^2]
- GC-based memory managemnet
- Error handling based on exceptions

[^1]: Although there are compilers like [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) and [codon](https://docs.exaloop.io/codon/) that can turn Python into machine code.

[^2]: Annotations in conjunction with type checker like [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#) can be employed to turn Python into statically typed language. Standard library supports type hints through [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) module.

**Rust**

- Compiled
- Statically typed
- Ownership-based memory managemnet
- Error handling based on return values

**Crystal**

- Compiled[^1]
- Statically typed
- GC-based memory managemnet
- Error handling based on exceptions
